# 2Player-Number-Picking-Game
This is a 2 player game where each player rolls the dice and can accumulate a current score where they can push to hold to their final score.
The catch is that if you roll a 1 you loose all your current score accumulated and the turn gets passed to the next player.
When a player reaches 100 thats when the game stops and the player who has 100 or greater wins the game.
